## Introduction

Despite the fact that it is hard to doubt the good intentions driving the followers
of positive psychology, the scientific approach that they utilize has epistemological
issues present in unattended presuppositions and logical fallacies. In the following
work I briefly discuss – on the basis of existing critical literature – the
faulty dialectic of the conscious and the unconscious, implicitly present in positive
psychology as well as the problematic tendency of the field to maintain morally
unbiased position, which, on the contrary, is inspired by the Anglo-American cultural
values.

## The Problem of Conscious Control

Positive psychology claims that anyone can reach their goals if their attitude is
positive enough: "Optimism is a tool to help the individual achieve the goals he has set
for himself" [@seligman2006#p. 291]. To this, [~@seligman2006] adds that the goals
must be realistic and achievable. This reasoning contradicts itself: On the one
hand, if a person sets a goal that is realistic and achievable, how is it any
different from the plans that would be successfully undertaken anyway? On the other
hand, if the goals are rather ambitious and only attainable by changing the present
situation, how can a person know in advance if they are realistic?
The issue with this reasoning lies in the implicit conscious nature of the concept
of goal setting [@miller2008].

Seligman, and positive psychology in general, believes that anyone can be reshaped
into a goal achiever by controlling his emotions and motivations through rational
self-reflection, as if one can assume full conscious control over one's attitude
and beliefs.

The notion of conscious goal setting brings forth Cartesian images: A homunculus that
sits in a person's head, controlling him. Although it is completely
legitimate to distinguish conscious, deliberate, and purposeful behavior from the
unconscious, instinctual behavior, claiming that a person can consciously control
his attitude, motivation and thoughts regresses psychology 200 years in the past, where
the consciousness and the psyche meant the same [@miller2008].

In the majority of people interests, dreams and plans come to be in life as the
possibilities and opportunities arise. They are largely determined by a variety
of dispositions: personality traits, attitudes, etc. None of those dispositions
are chosen or controlled consciously, especially not as instrumental means to an
end, that is, the goals. Nevertheless, the dispositions can be controlled by
practicing "self-control" or "self-discipline". This is usually necessary for the
individual to achieve long-term goals in opposition to falling for instinctual
behavior that leads to instant gratification. For that, the "self-control" requires
persistence and dedication which, again, are (unconscious) personal dispositions
[@miller2008].

> "It is only because computers, machines and businesses do not have minds of their
> own that they need plans, goals, targets and programmes" [@miller2008#p. 594].

The deficiency of "self-control" entails an interesting paradox – when a person
deliberately decides not to take a certain action but ends up accidentally doing
the exact opposite, leaving him with a sense of guilt due to his perceived "weakness
of will". [~@goldie2002] argues that the idea of "weakness of will" can only become
conceivable in an ethical framework, as a matter of controlling bodily desires in
favor of a "rationally conceived goal". This idea is very similar to the Aristotelian
temperate person that, through moral education, keeps his emotions and desires in
check, in the name of a rational good. [~@miller2008] claims that rational behavior
can only exist in relation to the cultural norms where there exist specific
definitions of good life and happiness – in other words, ideals in the context of a
political group. Any behavior that fails to live up to these ideals, therefore, is
deemed as a "weakness of will", "irrational behavior" etc.

It is based on the aforementioned arguments, among others, that [~@miller2008] claims
positive psychology to be based not on a strict scientific approach when describing
a successful, happy and healthy individual, but on cultural presuppositions that
portray a stereotype of a successful person in western culture: an outgoing, cheerful,
friendly, goal-oriented, and status-seeking extravert.

# The Problem of Morality

Positive psychology takes pride in using a strict scientific approach, unlike fields
like humanistic psychology [@peterson2006]. This means maintaining distance from
morals and ethics. For example, in research about "character strengths" Peterson
states:

> "...because good character and its components are morally esteemed, we worried that
> we were entering a domain so value-laden that our project was doomed from the start"
> [@peterson2006#p. 139].

Despite this, followers of positive psychology often use cultural and ethical concepts,
among which "eudaimonia" is more distinguished – a Greek term for human flourishing,
ultimate good and happiness. The concept of "eudaimonia", as well as "weakness of will"
leads us back to Aristotelian ethics. [~@lacan2014] in his seventh seminar speaks about
the dangers of happiness studies and criticizes Aristotle's ethics. Aristotle makes
a fundamental distinction between appetitive desires and moral reason – the separation between passions and rationality [@wright2013].

> "A whole large field of what constitutes for us the sphere of sexual desires is
> simply classed by Aristotle in the realm of monstrous anomalies - he uses the term
> "bestiality" with reference to them. What occurs at this level has nothing to do with
> moral evaluation. The ethical questions that Aristotle raises are located altogether
> elsewhere" [@lacan2014#p. 5]

The philosophical discourse of Aristotle is based on a very particular understanding
of truth – the rationally proved ultimate good. This in itself wouldn't have implications
worth the criticism if it wasn't for Descartes that an important tendency appeared: to
conflate the consciousness and rationality. Due to this, what opposed the consciousness -
namely the field of sexuality - was altogether discarded from the virtuous, ethical life.
It was therefore the unconscious in its entirety that - as it would seem - stood in
opposition to a good life, therefore the consciousness must have taken the reins of
power over it. This is precisely the Freud's metaphor that the ego psychologists
so eagerly adopted: "Thus in its relation to the id \[the unconscious] it \[the ego]
is like a man on horseback, who has to hold in check the superior strength of the
horse" [@freud2013#p. 25]. Although the rest of the quote is usually left out:
"Often a rider, if he is not to be parted from his horse, is obliged to
guide it where it wants to go" [@freud2013#p. 25]. All this is to say that
if an argument of happy life is made with the opposition of the conscious and the
unconscious, there is no ultimate rational good to speak of. Positive
psychology may claim - just like the entirety of self-help culture - that through
conscious control, one can get a hold of himself and have a good life but there is
no life without the unconscious (and certainly not a happy and ethical one, as I will
go on to show by Lacan's example). More importantly, the moral bias cannot be escaped
by pure rationality in science, especially in the field where the goal is to study
"what goes right in life" and "how to encourage it" [@peterson2006#p. 4].

Lacan claims that morality requires
a priori belief and to illustrate this, he compares the reasoning of Emmanuel
Kant to Marquis de Sade. Kant, in Aristotelian fashion, regards the sphere of
desires and passions as "pathological" and to overcome it, he offers us rather
formal rationality of his Categorical Imperative. It is interesting that, according
to Lacan, Sade adheres to exactly the same principles of rational universality but
reasons to prove the exact opposite: the goodness that comes from disposing of moral
restrictions in pursuit of sensual pleasure [@wright2013].

Is it possible to know "what goes right" in life by pure rational reasoning, devoid
of any moral components that are given a priori, i.e unconsciously?
Positive psychology, although portrayed as a strict field of science, is based
on a vast multitude of a priori cultural beliefs, which is evident in many different
fields of psychology in Anglo-American culture, be it ego psychology, humanistic
psychology or others. Since people acquire and go against values and beliefs mostly
by unconscious processes, without rigorous epistemological analysis, the ideas
of positive psychology like what is positive, desirable, strengths and weaknesses of
character and others are mere unconscious cultural values, namely Anglo-American
values that are often criticized by Lacan in his seminars, deeming them repressive and ego-centered.

Such an epistemologically unrefined approach can have many negative moral, political
and theological implications, such as pleasure commodification through capitalism
[@wright2013], military exploitation and "playing god" [@beier2014].

## Conclusion

Although in positive psychology the image of a successful and healthy person is based
on empirical research, it utilizes a stereotype of a particular person, which is
determined by the ignorance in the dialectic of the conscious and the unconscious.
The position positive psychology takes in regards to morals is, on the one hand,
formidable, as (ideally) the science should be morally unbiased but on the other
hand, when dealing with humanitarian sciences, it becomes impossible to make
conclusions without a priori values and the insistence against moral bias leaves
important factors unattended which, in turn, brings negative results.
